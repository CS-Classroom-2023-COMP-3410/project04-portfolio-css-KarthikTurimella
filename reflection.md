## Reflection on Portfolio Website Design

### Design Choices
I aimed for a clean and professional layout using a simple color scheme and consistent navigation across all pages. I incorporated responsive design principles to ensure the website works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### Challenges Faced
1. **Image Handling**: Managing and renaming DALLÂ·E-generated files for proper referencing was a key challenge.
2. **Responsiveness**: Ensuring that the layout remained functional without sideways scrolling on smaller screens required careful use of CSS media queries.

### Approach to Responsiveness
I used CSS media queries to adjust the navigation bar, text, and images for different screen sizes. The navbar collapses neatly for smaller screens, and images are scaled to fit the viewport.

Overall, this project improved my understanding of responsive design and web development best practices.
